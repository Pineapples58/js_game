# js_game
my attempt at a js game
- ok now i think the matrix is not the way to do this. it will take up alot of space 
- and it will decrease flexibility
- I should give the layout piece by piece
- so floor (0,0,100,100) (top_x, top_y, len_x, len_y)
- walls [[0,0,100,5],[0,0,5,100].....]
do it off a scale of 100 so it can easily be adjusted for different screen sizes
will need to adapt most functions to 

So i need to make floor wall door ect... object that will make up the room
finish making the new rooms

then update player contact
